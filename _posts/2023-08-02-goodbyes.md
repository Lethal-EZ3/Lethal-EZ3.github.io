    <title>Goodbyes</title>
  </head>
  <body>
 <p> We always think things are better</p>
 <p>On the other side.</p>
 <p>We never think things will change,</p>
 <p>Until what we have is gone.</p>
<br>
 <p>We take things for granted,</p>
 <p>Things others would seize in a moment.</p>
 <p>And now, Iâ€™ll only see you</p>
 <p>On the other side.</p>
<br>
 <p>Through the highs,</p>
 <p>Through the lows,</p>
 <p>We made vows:</p>
 <p>Only in death do we part.</p>
<br>
 <p>To the one I loved,</p>
 <p>To my friend,</p>
 <p>To my lover,</p>
 <p>To my future,</p>
 <p>To the one I lost,</p>
 <p><i>Goodbye.</i></p>
