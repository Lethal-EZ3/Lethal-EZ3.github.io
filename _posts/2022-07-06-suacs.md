  <p>Shouting. Screams. I look at the ocean around me. The eerie coast looms before me, bullets shredded the water as easily as they shredded the flesh of my team. Their bodies drift out to sea, never to be seen again. A searing pain surges. I watch bright flashes erupt from the concrete fortress. Deafening silence. The water is already stained a crimson hue. The light begins to fade as bullets continue to fly. Water seeps through my uniform as my gear slips beneath the dark red waves. I let myself silently drift away. The crimson shore had claimed one more. </p>
