  <p>I sleep through the days,<br>
Dreaming of you,<br>
Dreaming of your warm gaze.<br>
<br>
Without you my sight will haze,<br>
As the sheets stain red with the blood I drew.<br>
I sleep through the days.<br>
<br>
Life does not faze,<br>
And so I sleep, in a bed meant for two,<br>
Dreaming of your warm gaze.<br>

I fail to find you in the maze,<br>
The maze whose entry I rue,<br>
I sleep through the days.<br>
<br>
I spend my time thinking of the ways,<br>
The ways our love couldâ€™ve struck true.<br>
I sleep through the days,<br>
Dreaming of your warm gaze.<br>
