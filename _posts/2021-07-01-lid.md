  <p>I close my eyes and you are there,<br>
  I open them and you disappear.<br>
  Your presence is naught in the air.<br>
  <br>
  A sleepless night brings back the air,<br>
The air when I could hold you dear.<br>
I close my eyes and you are there.<br>
<br>
Your love leaves me in despair,<br>
As your sincerity is mere.<br>
Your presence is naught in the air.<br>
<br>
I long to return to you, but I would never dare,<br>
Dare to show up at your door, cowering in fear.<br>
I close my eyes and you are there.<br>
<br>
Other fish in the sea cannot compare, for you are rare,<br>
But now, you disappear.<br>
Your presence is naught in the air.<br>
<br>
You disappear, never to care,<br>
And your love leaves me in despair.<br>
I close my eyes and you are there,<br>
But your presence is naught in the air.<Br>
