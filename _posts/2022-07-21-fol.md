  <head>
  <p>Light filtered through the trees.<br>
I looked beside me, the grass is bare.<br>
Through the light, I feel the breeze,<br>
On my face, a single tear.<br>
<br>
The birds sing a song.<br>
A playful tune haunts me in my lair.<br>
It sounds so wrong.<br>
Yet here I am, alone in the forest bare.<br>
<br>
It sounds so wrong,<br>
The world is so dark.<br>
A broken front is not long,<br>
And her voice I hark.<br>

She never saw it, but she had left her mark.<br>
Dim light filtered through the trees.<br>
The world feels so dark,<br>
Through the light, I feel a cold breeze.<br>
