   <title>Poem for Spirit Voices</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>The Spirit Voices are heard.</p>
<p>The Queen speaks.</p>
<p>Her Voice is that of a songbird.</p>
    <br>
<p>Ten thousand stand allured,</p>
<p>Standing upon the peak,</p>
<p>The Spirit Voices are heard.</p>
    <br>
<p>No longer is she unheard,</p>
<p>Soaring above the seas of self-critique,</p>
<p>Her Voice is that of a songbird.</p>
<br>
<p>Even a single word,</p>
<p>Renders other voices bleak.</p>
<p>he Spirit Voices are heard.</p>
    <br>
<p>It is more than absurd,</p>
<p>To consider her voice meek.</p>
<p>Her Voice is that of a songbird.</p>
    <br>
<p>Ten thousand stand allured,</p>
<p>We stand on the peak.</p>
<p>The Spirit Voices are heard,</p>
<p>Her Voice is that of a songbird.</p>
