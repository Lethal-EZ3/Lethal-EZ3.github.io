Hello there! I'm Ethan "Lethal" Zhang. Iâ€™m a writer, golfer, and League of Legends player. I primarily write short stories as they are what I enjoy writing the most, however, I also write poems. As a golfer, I am an average player with scores ranging from high sixties to low eighties. Last, but definitely not least, I am a League Mid-Laner and ADC primarily, but I can play any role I or my teammates need.
