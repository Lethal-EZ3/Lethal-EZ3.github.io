  <body>
  <p>There are a million little things.</p>
<p>A million little moments I want to share with you.</p>
<p>A million little moments we will never share.</p>
<br>
<p>There are a million little things.</p>
<p>A million little things I want to do with you.</p>
<p>A million things I will never get to do.</p>
<br>
<p>There are a million little things.</p>
<p>A million little things I want to share with you.</p>
<p>A million little things we will never share.</p>
<br>
<p>For the million things I want to do,</p>
<p>All I wished was for one to come true.</p>
<p>My love for you will never be seen,</p>
<p>And there is nothing I can do.</p>
<br>
<p>For the million things I wanted to share,</p>
<p>All I wished for was to share a few.</p>
<p>The things we share, they will never be seen</p>
<p>The time we share, it will never be passed,</p>
<p>For, your head and my heart, will never be together.</p>
