  <p>Our eyes silently met that day. Now, my eyes only meet the stars in the night. I knew I could never have her from the day we met, and yet, I played along, and yet, I fell in love. My heart shattered over someone who would never be mine. Maybe in another timeline we’d be each other’s. Maybe in another world we would have fallen in love. <i>Just maybe. </i></p>
