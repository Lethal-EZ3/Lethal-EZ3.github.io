Hi there! I'm Ethan "Lethal" Zhang. Iâ€™m a writer, golfer, and League player. I primarily write short stories as they are my field of interest, however, I also write poems. As a golfer, I am an average player with scores ranging from high sixties to low eighties. Last, but definitely not least, I am a League Mid-Laner primarily, but I can play any role I need.
