  <p>The world was quiet. </p>
<p>All I saw was the darkness that surrounded me. Her brilliant eyes shone in the distance. </p>
<p>All I heard was my voice and hers. I had loved her deeply, and now she was merely a memory for me to reflect upon. </p>
<p>Wistful memories. That's All she would ever be.</p>
