   <title>One Last Ride</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>Three years, a chapter of life,</p>
 <p>Coming to an end.</p>
 <p>An era of success,</p>
 <p>Bounded by one last ride.</p>
<br>
 <p>Whether in a blaze of glory,</p>
 <p>Or a fountain of tears,</p>
 <p>A new chapter begins,</p>
 <p>With anotherâ€™s end.</p>
<br>
 <p>The people you shape,</p>
 <p>The people you help,</p>
 <p>The people you call your fans,</p>
 <p>We toast to one last ride.</p>
</br>
 <p>To a new chapter,</p>
 <p>To a new era,</p>
 <p>One last ride,</p>
 <p>And the page turns.</p>

<p>This poem was written as a gift for the Twitch Streamer (and content creator on other platforms) EndraEXE for her last stream. She is a very chill person and streamer. Please go check out her<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EndraEXE"> <a>channel/archive</a> and keep an eye out for if she returns!</p>
