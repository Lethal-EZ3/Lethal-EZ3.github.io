  <p>The task force had nothing left. Vehicles were nothing but burning wrecks. The flames cast an orange glow on the night-time carnage. Soldiers slumped against the walls as blood splattered on the walls behind them. The flags on their shoulders were stained. A minuscule number of soldiers remained as hordes of combatants encircled them. They stood up, defiantly picking up their weapons as muzzles flashed. Angry torrents of fire ripped through soldiers as they fell one by one. To the last man: fight on. To the last bullet: fly like a bat from hell. To the enemy: go to hell.</p>
