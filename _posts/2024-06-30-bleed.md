<p>If I showed you how broken I was,</p>
<p>Would you still hold me?</p>
<p>Knowing I would cut you.</p>
<p>Would you still hold me?</p>
<p>Knowing to try your best to heal me.</p>
<p>Would you still hold me?</p>
<p>Knowing your hands would bleed with every touch.</p>
<p>Would you still hold me?</p>
<p>Knowing I bleed nothing but love for you every day.</p>
<p>Would you still hold me?</p>
<p>Or would you up and leave?</p>
<p>Because I was broken.</p>
<p>Because I wasn’t enough for you.</p>
<p>Because you know you’d end up bleeding too.</p>
